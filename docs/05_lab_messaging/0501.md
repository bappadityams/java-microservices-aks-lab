# Create an Azure Service Bus resource

First, you need to create an Azure Service Bus namespace and one or more queues to send messages to. In your implementation, you will create a queue named `visits-requests`. You can use the following guidance to implement these changes:

- [Use the Azure CLI to create a Service Bus namespace and a queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-cli).
- [Use Azure CLI to create a Service Bus topic and subscriptions to the topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-tutorial-topics-subscriptions-cli).

Make sure to create the Service Bus namespace with the **Premium** SKU, since this is required in order to support JMS 2.0 messaging. You should also add a connection string to your Service Bus namespace in the Key Vault instance you provisioned earlier in this lab, so the microservices can retrieve its value.

{: .note }
> As a more secure alternative, you could use managed identities associated with your microservices to connect directly to the Service Bus namespace. However, in this lab, you will store the connection string in your Key Vault.

The connection to the Service Bus needs to be stored in the `spring.jms.servicebus.connection-string` application property. Name your Key Vault secret `SPRING-JMS-SERVICEBUS-CONNECTIONSTRING` and add the following section to the `application.yml` file in your configuration repository.

   ```yaml
     jms:
       servicebus:
         connection-string: ${spring.jms.servicebus.connectionstring}
         idle-timeout: 60000
         pricing-tier: premium
   ```

{: .note }
> Particular attention to indentation as shown above is important: `jms` should be at the same indentation level as `config`, `datasource` and `cloud`.

This translates the secret in Key Vault to the correct application property for your microservices. This usage of properties is described in the following documentation: [Special Characters in Property Name](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/current/reference/html/index.html#special-characters-in-property-name).

## Step by step guidance

1. On your lab computer, in Git Bash window, from the Git Bash prompt, run the following command to create a Service Bus namespace. Note that the name of the namespace needs to be globally unique, so adjust it accordingly in case the randomly generated name is already in use. You will need to create the namespace with the **Premium** sku. This is needed to use JMS 2.0 messaging later on in the lab.

   ```bash
   SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE=sb-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID

   az servicebus namespace create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --sku Premium
   ```

1. You can now create a queue in this namespace called visits-requests.

   ```bash
   az servicebus queue create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --namespace-name $SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE \
       --name visits-requests
   ```

1. Retrieve the value of the connection string to the newly created Service Bus namespace:

   ```bash
   SERVICEBUS_CONNECTIONSTRING=$(az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --namespace-name $SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE \
       --name RootManageSharedAccessKey \
       --query primaryConnectionString \
       --output tsv)
   ```

1. Create a new Key Vault secret for this connection string.

   ```bash
   az keyvault secret set \
       --name SPRING-JMS-SERVICEBUS-CONNECTIONSTRING \
       --value $SERVICEBUS_CONNECTIONSTRING \
       --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME
   ```

1. In your configuration repository's `application.yml` file add the below fragment directly under the sql configuration (under line 19).

   ```yaml
     jms:
       servicebus:
         connection-string: ${spring.jms.servicebus.connectionstring}
         idle-timeout: 60000
         pricing-tier: premium
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Particular attention to indentation as shown above is important: `jms` should be at the same indentation level as `config`, `datasource` and `cloud`.  Your resulting YAML should look like this for the top spring config: 

   ```yaml
   # COMMON APPLICATION PROPERTIES
   
   server:
     # start services on random port by default
     # port: 0
     # The stop processing uses a timeout which provides a grace period during which existing requests will be allowed to complete but no new requests will be permitted
     shutdown: graceful
   
   # embedded database init, supports mysql too trough the 'mysql' spring profile
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://mysql-petclinic-38cb12.mysql.database.azure.com:3306/petclinic?useSSL=true&serverTimezone=UTC
       username: mysql_conn
       azure.passwordless-enabled: true
     sql:
       init:
         schema-locations: classpath*:db/mysql/schema.sql
         data-locations: classpath*:db/mysql/data.sql
         mode: ALWAYS
     jms:
       servicebus:
         connection-string: ${spring.jms.servicebus.connectionstring}
         idle-timeout: 60000
         pricing-tier: premium
     sleuth:
       sampler:
         probability: 1.0
     cloud:
       config:
         # Allow the microservices to override the remote properties with their own System properties or config file
         allow-override: true
         # Override configuration with any local property source
         override-none: true
     jpa:
       open-in-view: false
       hibernate:
         ddl-auto: none
   ```

1. Commit and push your changes to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'added service bus'
   git push
   ```
